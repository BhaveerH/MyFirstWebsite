            This critical analysis piece aims to discuss the concept proposed by
            McLuhan which is entitled, “The medium is the message”. The basic
            idea of the term is that the manner in which the message is being
            relayed is more important than the content itself. The manner
            (medium) in which the information is being sent and received by the
            viewer has more importance than the message. There are however some
            controversial issues that are incongruent with the concept that
            McLuhan has proposed. Some examples in his discussion may appear
            extreme. In this critical analysis the key ideas will be discussed
            and analysed.
            <br />
            <br />
            One example that McLuhan discusses can be used to support his
            concept. Cubism shows us how the use of abstract elements can be
            used to form artworks. It is this form of artwork that allows the
            viewer to see the perspective of the artist through the medium and
            not just the content. “Cubism, by seizing on instant sensory
            awareness, suddenly announced that the medium is the message”.
            <br />
            <br />
            In his discussion about the concept, he uses the lightbulb as the
            medium. The lightbulb itself provides no content or information. The
            medium, which is the lightbulb, provides an experience which would
            not be there if the lightbulb was not present. Without the lightbulb
            there would be darkness. The lightbulb provides light which in
            essence will provide an experience that would not have been there
            and provides a platform for many things. Thus, the lightbulb itself
            which is the medium is the actual message. “A lightbulb creates an
            environment by its mere presence”.
            <br />
            <br />
            Controversially, he discusses the idea of the content of television
            broadcasts not having an impact on society. In essence what kids are
            watching will have an impact on them. If a child chooses to watch
            violent programs, he will engage with it and possibly become a
            violent person. If a child chooses to watch kids’ programs, he will
            not pick up the habits of violence. Television will have a different
            effect on each child depending on what they watch.
            <br />
            <br />
            From a Digital Arts perspective it is very interesting to relate to.
            During the time of McLuhan, the internet was something of the
            future, yet his philosophical conclusion would prove to be correct.
            The internet, social media and media in general are the medium to
            such an extent and he hypothesized that. During McLuhan’s time the
            media was not that extensive as we see today. The internet and
            social media all form different forms of mediums. The medium itself
            has an effect and has a role to play in society. The medium takes
            precedent over the content/information.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a future software engineer or web developer, the role that I play
            is important in not being negligent and taking for granted the
            mediums that I can use in my profession. It allows for a deeper
            understanding when a client comes to me for an opportunity. Content
            will not only be the main element, taking into consideration the
            different mediums and platforms available can be an advantage.
