            Although a viewer may not see the visual difference on a webpage
            with semantic markup, it is vitally important to web crawlers and
            browsers. By creating a semantic webpage, you indirectly help the
            viewer by telling the browser how to display the content. Semantic
            markup also helps with accessibility for those with disabilities.
            Many of the semantic HTML tags were implemented in the webpages.
            These include header, footer, main, article, section, and nav. Just
            by adding these simple tags during the development of the website,
            this benefits the developer, the viewer, and the browser.
            <br />
            Search Engine Optimization plays an important role if the content
            found on a website is what the viewer has searched. To further
            assist search engines and web crawlers, metadata tagging and
            microformats were implemented when developing the website. When
            implementing metadata tagging, tags such as author, description,
            keywords, and viewport were added. Microformats differs from
            metadata tagging by adding certain properties to an object’s class
            that can be recognized by search engines. Some of the microformat
            properties used included h-*, p-* and u-*.
            <br />
            JavaScript adds a sense of fashion with its variety of features to
            webpages. To further enhance the website, some JavaScript functions
            were used draw the viewers’ attention while others were used to help
            navigate through the site. Event listeners were placed throughout
            the web pages to identify when links were clicked to assist the
            viewers to other web pages. An automated typing function was also
            implemented to allow the viewer to believe that the site was
            communicating with them. To show the viewer some past work, a
            slideshow reel function was developed. This was an improvement over
            the smaller images that were previously implemented. The slideshow
            reel provided a modern effect to the webpage.
            <br />
            Using an external JavaScript library was a new experience and
            allowed for exposure to be gained. Using a slideshow carousel
            library, Slick.js, after implementing my own function showed how
            much time and effort could be saved. Furthermore, additional
            features of the library (which were unknown before), ignited new
            ideas of how these would positively affect the user experience as
            well as add unique features to a simple slideshow carousel. For a
            portfolio page, the skills gained should be prioritised, however,
            how these skills are presented can further uplift a viewer’s mindset
            into the capabilities shown.
            <br />
            The navigation between the different pages of the website were
            originally handled through html. For assignment two, this was
            iterated so that JavaScript handled the navigation throughout the
            pages. Each section contained its own JavaScript file and was
            attached to its respective html file. This solution fulfilled the
            brief but was not efficient because if there needed to be a change,
            all the subsequent JavaScript files would need to be edited. Hence,
            a further iteration was made so that only a single JavaScript file
            managed the navigation for the design, blog and portfolio pages.
            This proved to be a much more efficient and effective way to manage
            the navigation throughout the website.
            <br />
            Responsive design is a necessity in today’s world. Accessibility
            plays an important role in websites wherein a non-responsive design
            can cause a viewer to not want to explore the rest of the webpages.
            Three viewport sizes were developed for this website. The browser
            inspector was used as a guideline and media queries were used to
            execute the different views. The views were developed on: the
            current laptop size, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro and the Apple iPad Air.
            It is also for convenience for the viewer, which in turn will be
            able to reach a larger viewer base as they can access the website
            from whichever device they have available at the time.
