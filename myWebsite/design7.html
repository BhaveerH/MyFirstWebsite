            Although a viewer may not see the visual difference on a webpage
            with semantic markup, it is vitally important to web crawlers and
            browsers. By creating a semantic webpage, you indirectly help the
            viewer by telling the browser how to display the content. Semantic
            markup also helps with accessibility for those with disabilities.
            Many of the semantic HTML tags were implemented in the webpages.
            These include header, footer, main, article, section, and nav. Just
            by adding these simple tags during the development of the website,
            this benefits the developer, the viewer, and the browser.
            <br />
            Search Engine Optimization plays an important role if the content
            found on a website is what the viewer has searched. To further
            assist search engines and web crawlers, metadata tagging and
            microformats were implemented when developing the website. When
            implementing metadata tagging, tags such as author, description,
            keywords, and viewport were added. Microformats differs from
            metadata tagging by adding certain properties to an object’s class
            that can be recognized by search engines. Some of the microformat
            properties used included h-*, p-* and u-*.
            <br />
            JavaScript adds a sense of fashion with its variety of features to
            webpages. To further enhance the website, some JavaScript functions
            were used draw the viewers attention while others were used to help
            navigate through the site. Event listeners were placed throughout
            the web pages to identify when links were clicked to assist the
            viewers to other web pages. An automated typing function was also
            implemented to allow the viewer to believe that the site was
            communicating with them. To show the viewer some past work, a
            slideshow reel function was developed. This was an improvement over
            the smaller images that were previously implemented. The slideshow
            reel provided a modern effect to the webpage.
            <br />
            Responsive design is a necessity in today’s world. Accessibility
            plays an important role in websites wherein a non-responsive design
            can cause a viewer to not want to explore the rest of the webpages.
            Three viewport sizes were developed for this website. The browser
            inspector was used as a guideline and media queries were used to
            execute the different views. The views were developed on: the
            current laptop size, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro and the Apple iPad Air.

            Colour schemes in conjunction with typography can dictate the
            formality and style of a website. Using colours that spark emotion
            from a viewer can attract them to continue and engage with the site.
            By developing an interface design that comprises of visual design
            and interaction design the functionality is maximized while allowing
            the viewer easy and simple navigation. Furthermore, this inspires a
            viewer to want to return to the site. This was all done through the
            colour scheme, typography, and iconography that has been included
            within the website.
            <br />
            A website’s design can often set a voice and tone in the way that it
            is displayed. Simple design choices like having rounded edges or
            sharp edges on a border can communicate the tone to a viewer. Within
            the website many different border-edge types can be used to
            communicate the tone to the viewer. In sections such as the critical
            writings, style guides and the portfolio, the sharp edge border was
            used. The sharp border edges are often associated with
            professionalism and reliability. It is also seen as a minimalistic
            choice due to its sharp and clean edges. Many of the sections also
            have rounded edges that convey tones of informality and
            friendliness. These were used as not to intimidate the viewer and to
            create a more friendly environment. By using both the sharp-edged
            border to convey professionalism and the round edged border to
            convey friendliness to create balanced webpage. By making use of
            both types of borders ensured that the viewer felt both a
            professional yet approachable tone.
