            Although a viewer may not see the visual difference on a webpage
            with semantic markup, it is vitally important to web crawlers and
            browsers. By creating a semantic webpage, you indirectly help the
            viewer by telling the browser how to display the content. Semantic
            markup also helps with accessibility for those with disabilities.
            Many of the semantic HTML tags were implemented in the webpages.
            These include header, footer, main, article, section, and nav. Just
            by adding these simple tags during the development of the website,
            this benefits the developer, the viewer, and the browser.
            <br />
            Search Engine Optimization plays an important role if the content
            found on a website is what the viewer has searched. To further
            assist search engines and web crawlers, metadata tagging and
            microformats were implemented when developing the website. When
            implementing metadata tagging, tags such as author, description,
            keywords, and viewport were added. Microformats differs from
            metadata tagging by adding certain properties to an object’s class
            that can be recognized by search engines. Some of the microformat
            properties used included h-*, p-* and u-*.

            Colour schemes in conjunction with typography can dictate the
            formality and style of a website. Using colours that spark emotion
            from a viewer can attract them to continue and engage with the site.
            By developing an interface design that comprises of visual design
            and interaction design the functionality is maximized while allowing
            the viewer easy and simple navigation. Furthermore, this inspires a
            viewer to want to return to the site. This was all done through the
            colour scheme, typography, and iconography that has been included
            within the website.
            <br />
            A website’s design can often set a voice and tone in the way that it
            is displayed. Simple design choices like having rounded edges or
            sharp edges on a border can communicate the tone to a viewer. Within
            the website many different border-edge types can be used to
            communicate the tone to the viewer. In sections such as the critical
            writings, style guides and the portfolio, the sharp edge border was
            used. The sharp border edges are often associated with
            professionalism and reliability. It is also seen as a minimalistic
            choice due to its sharp and clean edges. Many of the sections also
            have rounded edges that convey tones of informality and
            friendliness. These were used as not to intimidate the viewer and to
            create a more friendly environment. By using both the sharp-edged
            border to convey professionalism and the round edged border to
            convey friendliness to create balanced webpage. By making use of
            both types of borders ensured that the viewer felt both a
            professional yet approachable tone.

            <b>Theoretical</b>
            <br />
            After being exposed to Marshal McLuhan’s, “The Medium is the
            Message”, thinking more deeply about how the medium used could
            benefit and attract viewers was important. To implement this an
            abstract background was used. The abstract background provides
            additional information that I am a person who promotes young, fresh,
            and risk-taking designs and not afraid to explore abstract ideas.
            This will communicate to the viewer that I am a web designer who
            will ensure innovation and creativity in my work.
            <br />
            Communication is a bidirectional element. Learning about how the
            communication between machine and humans exist was not something
            previously explored until now. Humans communicate to machines via
            input such as mouse and keyboard, however, for machines to
            communicate back many parameters must be implemented for this to be
            possible. The theory gained about different elements such as
            semantic markup, colour schemes, tone, metadata tagging and
            microformats were all executed into the creative and technical
            aspects. All these individual elements were used in the webpage and
            work together to help the communication between machine and human to
            exist and to grow with time.
