            <b>Aim</b>
            <br />
            The aim of this paper was to provide the reader with a firmer
            understanding of how information geographies are spread across the
            world. By explaining and displaying various types of geographic
            information, statistics and data, the aim of showing how unevenly
            balanced and spread the geographies of participation and
            representation are and how some areas are over estimated is well
            executed.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Information geographies and (im)mutable augmentations</b>
            <br />
            “This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are
            immutable can result in high stakes as annotations of place emerge
            as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people
            trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations
            (Zook and Graham 2007)” [1]. Allowing local people to produce
            content about there own country would greatly make the spread of
            information geographies more even. However, other countries
            producing content about another helps the content become less bias
            and more accurate and truthful. Political influence plays a vital
            and important role in how local content is produced. Local people
            may have their lives at steak for produced content that will affect
            their country in a negative way, which may indicate to the imbalance
            of content produced in more oppressed countries.
            <br />
            “A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if
            nobody finds it. Likewise, how places are presented within
            informational augmentations fundamentally affects how they are used
            or brought into being (Graham and Zook 2013)” [1]. I believe the
            writer uses this statement as a metaphor to show how countries with
            a poor influence in contributing or accessing online information
            will become if they don’t start creating, contributing, and
            accessing digital information and data. The metaphor used is
            effective as it is what happens in today’s modern society which
            allows it to be relatable. Most tourists use a Search Engine to
            locate restaurants nearby that have good ratings, the restaurants
            that do not have an online profile will have less awareness and
            representation. Similarly, the countries that have a poor digital
            platform will soon have little representation and their voice not as
            powerful as that of other countries.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Geographies of access and enablement</b>
            <br />
            A similar pattern emerges throughout reading, that it is mainly the
            African countries that are falling behind to the rest of the world,
            as seen by the graphical representations. It can be seen however
            that some growth has occurred in certain parts of Africa. However,
            equal opportunity and growth need to be spread more evenly
            throughout the African continent. Controversially, it can be seen in
            some countries, such as India, that although the population density
            may be large, the internet penetration is significantly lower than
            some of the countries in Africa. It can be seen today that India has
            had significant growth in internet penetration since these
            statistics were released with India becoming a tech hub for
            futuristic technology and low broadband affordability, whereas
            African countries have a slow but steady growth rate.
