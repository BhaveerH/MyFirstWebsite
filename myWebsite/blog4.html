            <b>Aim</b>
            <br />
            The aim of this paper was to provide the reader with a firmer
            understanding of how information geographies are spread across the
            world. By explaining and displaying various types of geographic
            information, statistics and data, the aim of showing how unevenly
            balanced and spread the geographies of participation and
            representation are and how some areas are over estimated is well
            executed.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Information geographies and (im)mutable augmentations</b>
            <br />
            “This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are
            immutable can result in high stakes as annotations of place emerge
            as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people
            trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations
            (Zook and Graham 2007)”. Allowing local people to produce content
            about there own country would greatly make the spread of information
            geographies more even. However, other countries producing content
            about another helps the content become less bias and more accurate
            and truthful. Political influence plays a vital and important role
            in how local content is produced. Local people may have their lives
            at steak for produced content that will affect their country in a
            negative way, which may indicate to the imbalance of content
            produced in more oppressed countries.
            <br />
            “A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if
            nobody finds it. Likewise, how places are presented within
            informational augmentations fundamentally affects how they are used
            or brought into being (Graham and Zook 2013)”. I believe the writer
            uses this statement as a metaphor to show how countries with a poor
            influence in contributing or accessing online information will
            become if they don’t start creating, contributing, and accessing
            digital information and data. The metaphor used is effective as it
            is what happens in today’s modern society which allows it to be
            relatable. Most tourists use a Search Engine to locate restaurants
            nearby that have good ratings, the restaurants that do not have an
            online profile will have less awareness and representation.
            Similarly, the countries that have a poor digital platform will soon
            have little representation and their voice not as powerful as that
            of other countries.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Geographies of access and enablement</b>
            <br />
            A similar pattern emerges throughout reading, that it is mainly the
            African countries that are falling behind to the rest of the world,
            as seen by the graphical representations. It can be seen however
            that some growth has occurred in certain parts of Africa. However,
            equal opportunity and growth need to be spread more evenly
            throughout the African continent. Controversially, it can be seen in
            some countries, such as India, that although the population density
            may be large, the internet penetration is significantly lower than
            some of the countries in Africa. It can be seen today that India has
            had significant growth in internet penetration since these
            statistics were released with India becoming a tech hub for
            futuristic technology and low broadband affordability, whereas
            African countries have a slow but steady growth rate.
