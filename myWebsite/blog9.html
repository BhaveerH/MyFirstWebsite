            The pandemic exposed the essence for a more diverse need of
            technology through the different sections of society. E-learning was
            a drastic change that has still not been perfected during the
            extreme times of the pandemic. Besides e-learning the basic concept
            of virtual communication, which was existent during the pandemic,
            has still not affected the digital divide in the manner it should
            have. At the rate technology is growing with new concepts and
            inventions taking the world by surprise the world cannot afford for
            the digital divide to widen.
            <br />
            <br />
            “One solution has been platforms built for use on basic mobile
            phones” [1]. It is clearly seen today that there is a vast array of
            mobile device manufacturers that create devices from an entry-level
            specification to flagship models. Each year these entry level models
            aim to provide basic essential features while trying to keep the
            price at a minimum. These basic features limit the storage space,
            the RAM, the screen quality, the processor and much more. It can be
            agreed that mobile devices are capable of being used as a platform
            for education, but the entry-level models will restrict learners
            from maximizing their potential and grasping the basic concepts
            needed.
            <br />
            <br />
            “But, beside the difficulties of using mobile phones for learning,
            40% of students do not have any form of access to the Internet at
            home” [1]. In addition to the previous paragraph, an entry-level
            mobile device or in fact any device with internet capabilities is
            very limited without a connection to the internet. With the rise in
            data/Wi-Fi prices even the ‘middle-class’ are beginning to feel the
            strain. Just imagining how areas and societies that are
            underprivileged could possibly afford a mobile device and data
            prices is frightening. “The digital divide is complicating
            educators’ efforts to ensure learning continuity. It is also
            threatening to exacerbate existing inequalities as the lack of
            access is disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged”. It
            can be seen that just trying to connect to the internet creates a
            domino effect of problems. From accessibility to an internet capable
            device to data/Wi-Fi prices etc., there seems to be one problem
            after another after trying to accomplish one hurdle.
            <br />
            <br />
            “The UK government is lending laptops to 15 year-old students who
            did not have one. Egypt has handed free SIM cards to students and
            has promised to cover the costs of up to a 20% increase in all
            subscribers' monthly downloads. Thailand has created a scheme of 10
            free gigabytes of data usage for mobile users” [1]. Some governments
            have placed some effort in trying to help society decrease this
            digital divide, however some countries who do not have the resources
            and funds struggle to support the people who need it. Those
            countries who are investing in decreasing the digital divide cannot
            support those who need it forever. Most of these resources that were
            allocated only came about due to the pandemic. What will governments
            do once the pandemic ends? This short-term plan is a temporary
            solution, but a long-term plan needs to be investigated or else the
            digital divide will definitely widen.
