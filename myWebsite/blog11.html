            By reusing code functions during programming can help save a lot of
            time, money, and effort. This is where external JavaScript libraries
            come into play. If another programmer has shared their useful code
            and documentation for an element that is desired, it can greatly
            benefit the user of the code and may even expose them to other
            features to improve the creativeness, user interface and user
            experience. Documentation of the extra features with the library are
            often included to help a programmer using the library to view the
            extra functions that can be implemented.
            <br />
            The implemented external JavaScript library was called Slick.js [3].
            This library serves as a slide show carousel. A slideshow carousel
            was coded for the previous assignment; however, this library
            presented many additional features that would serve to uplift both
            the user experience and the creativity. A slide show carousel may be
            a simple element on a website but its value to share its space with
            multiple images benefits both the user interface and the user
            experience.
            <br />
            For the previous assignment, the slide carousel was simple, and the
            speed would remain the same, thus considered too quick or slow
            depending on the viewer. With Slick.js [3], a viewer may hover over
            the slideshow image to view it for a longer period of time. It also
            caters for mobile devices where they may ‘swipe’ to move along the
            reel as well. The library also contained multiple view modes for the
            carousel to further provide the programmer with multiple options to
            affect their user interface, user experience and creativity.
            <br />
            The slide show reel is an element used widely throughout many modern
            websites. It draws the viewer's attention and their focus for longer
            than if the images were laid out in grid form. A subtle yet
            effective element that is part of the slideshow is the ‘dots’ that
            show the current position of the carousel. Much time was spent
            during the previous assignment in trying to make the ‘dots’ function
            in an equivalent way to the current library in use. To no avail, the
            ‘dots’ function was left out previously, thus proving that external
            JavaScript libraries help save time and effort when programming.
            When implementing the Slick.js library [3], much difficulty was
            found trying to get the library to function. It was not known before
            that jQuery also needed to be implemented alongside the Slick.js
            library [3] for it to function as intended.
            <br />
            Through research it was discovered that there are endless libraries
            available to be implemented into websites. It was then narrowed down
            to those which would add to the user experience and creativity of a
            portfolio site. A strong contender was the fullPage.js library [1].
            This library creates Fullscreen scrolling websites which allow for
            both vertical and horizontal scrolling in a creative way that
            influences the user interface and the user experience. This library
            was excluded for use due the fact that it would be inconsistent with
            the other webpages if only applied to the portfolio page, it would
            change the flow of the website and would stand out as if the website
            had multiple designers who did not collaborate. Another JavaScript
            library considered was the Anime.js library [2]. This library allows
            for a designer to add animations to the website. If added, this
            library would become an asset to both the user experience and the
            creativity of the site. A viewer would become intrigued by a moving
            element within a static space, thus changing the dynamic and
            attracting the viewers attention, drawing them to explore the
            website. It was decided not to engage with this library as to simply
            not detract the viewers attention from the main focus, the
            portfolio.
            <br />
            With a variety of options and a short time to implement the
            libraries, the choices made were the outcomes desired. With
            continuous iterations planned for future work, efforts will be made
            to explore more of these libraries to implement and improve the
            site. Implementing the libraries can show the skill one desires to
            express, to intrigue the viewers and increase the experience gained
            in implementing them.
