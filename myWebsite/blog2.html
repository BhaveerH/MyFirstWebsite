            The encoding and organising of HTML to illustrate the description of
            a webpage’s content rather than its aesthetics, defines semantic
            markup. This critical analysis aims to discuss what semantic markup
            is and to go into detail of why it is necessary. Both HTML and CSS
            are used in the development of web design, contributing in different
            ways. HTML focuses on the foundation and layout of the content for
            the site while CSS focuses primarily on the style and aesthetics.
            The use of different HTML tags helps the browser identify how to
            display the selected content as intended.
            <br />
            <br />
            “Writing semantic markup means understanding the hierarchy of your
            content and how both users and machines will read it”. The more
            well-structured a web page is laid out allows for the viewer to
            obtain the important information more smoothly. By having a well
            formatted web page both the viewer and the browser can differentiate
            clearly through the various sections displayed. By incorporating
            HTML and CSS correctly, the webpage can be considered as both
            semantic and aesthetically pleasing. This would allow for the
            browser to display the content correctly and for the viewer to
            understand the content.
            <br />
            <br />
            The relationship between semantic markup and accessibility has grown
            throughout the years. As web pages continue to become more advanced,
            they could become difficult for those with disabilities to access.
            However, by designing a web page with semantic markup in mind, the
            easier it becomes for those with disabilities to access with the
            browser being able to understand the content structure. An example
            would be a user with the disability of sight. By having well
            formatted HTML on a webpage, the browser can assist the user by
            using text-to-speech software. The browser would be able to read the
            article correctly due to understanding the content described by the
            HTML tags. Without it the browser would not be able to distinguish
            between the article and the other irrelevant information on the
            page.
            <br />
            <br />
            To allow for web crawlers to find a web page relevant to its search
            and recommend it to the user, the use of semantic HTML and using the
            relevant tags are important. Search engine optimization (SEO) allows
            the webpage to communicate the important content to the web
            crawlers. The hierarchy used in the semantic markup make it possible
            to help these web crawlers find relevant keywords related to what
            was searched. By using the correct tags and containers in the HTML
            code, the search engine can easily rank the web page accordingly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Maintaining a web page to keep content updated allows for semantic
            markup to come in handy. By using semantic markup, the HTML code is
            organised in its related tags and containers. Hence, much time would
            be saved as updating specific sections becomes faster and easier to
            locate. It also relates to accessibility in a different way, by
            allowing for different web designers to easily iterate the site
            without uncertainty of editing the wrong sections.
            <br />
            <br />
            In conclusion, the benefits of creating a web page using semantic
            markup can be seen. The application of semantic markup is necessary
            as it incorporates accessibility, maintenance, and search engine
            optimization. It greatly benefits both the user and browser in
            interpreting and displaying the important content.
