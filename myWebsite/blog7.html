            The elements of User Experience and User Interface plays an
            important role in how the machine communicates with the user.
            Communication includes both the experience and interactions a user
            is exposed to and affiliated with. Both these elements give a
            website life by fusing the fundamental foundations of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. This critical analysis will discuss the User Experience
            and User Interface decisions made during the development of my
            website.
            <br />
            <br />
            Readability and legibility are an important consideration with
            regard to UX and UI. “Readability refers to the way in which blocks
            of texts or large complex chunks of information are arranged on a
            page. Legibility generally refers to the how the typeface/font is
            designed” [1]. The font style used was Khand with a San-serif
            classification. “Generally, San Serif are seen as good for headings
            and small portions of text” [1]. Minimalistic, crisp, fresh, and
            modern were the styles achieved and desired by this type of
            typography.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another important category of UX design is using tabs. By using
            tabs, the user can explore the website more without having to use
            the ‘back’ button built into browsers. Many of the hyperlinks within
            the webpages opened in a new tab. For most of these hyperlinks,
            these worked well. However, some of the hyperlinks opening in a new
            tab were considered to be unnecessary and frustrating to the user.
            These hyperlinks will be changed in the next iteration to help
            improve the user experience. The approach will be that links that
            contain content referring to the current webpage will open in the
            same tab. Links that refer to external content will be loaded in a
            new tab.
            <br />
            <br />
            “SHAPES IMPLY MEANING” [1]. Although in this reading/lecture the
            shapes are directed specifically towards buttons, the essence could
            also be extracted for shapes as borders in general. Who would have
            thought that the simplicity of a curved edge compared to a sharp
            edge can help dictate formality and tones of a webpage! In my
            webpages both these types of borders are used to communicate the
            formality/informality to the user. The aim of using both these
            styles was to create a balance between professionalism and
            friendliness.
            <br />
            <br />
            Responsive design is a necessity in today’s society. The vast topic
            of accessibly contributes to this, with many users connecting to the
            web on different devices with different dimensions. This element of
            development focused only one type of device. Future iterations will
            definitely incorporate a wider range of responsive design. To be
            able to reach a wider user base and create a more efficient
            experience and interface for the user, this will definitely increase
            the accessibly and communication between the machine (the browser)
            and the user.
            <br />
            <br />
            Colours may seem to be a simple element; however, they can define
            emotions and tones that the user feels. The tones of the colours
            themselves can affect the user. Too bright and the site becomes
            difficult to read and to focus on, yet too dull or soft can emote a
            lack of emotion or passion from the user. “Colour to distinguish
            between elements in a series of similar forms” [1]. Colour
            contributes to emphasis and dominance. The colours used in my
            webpages are of tones that are subtle yet still evoke various
            emotions of trust, boldness, happiness, and passion.
