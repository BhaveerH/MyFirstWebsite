            <b>Header and Footer</b>
            <br />
            The header and footer used in the webpages contain a grey background
            that is blurred put partially to provide the desired effect of
            frosted glass. This was used to make the content placed on them more
            prominent. The header contained important information such as the
            title/authorâ€™s name as well as a navigation panel to the other
            webpages. The footer contained a panel with the programming
            languages I am proficient in. Throughout the webpages, the style of
            the header and footer showed consistency so that the viewer does not
            become overwhelmed by the number of changes. Fig.3 below shows the
            header and footer from the webpages.

            <b>Overall Design</b>
            <br />
            The overall design of the webpage was divided into two or three
            sections. This was to keep the viewer engaged within the webpages
            and to overcrowd too much information to the viewer at once. The
            homepage consisted of three main sections. The first section was
            very simple and minimalist but grabbed the viewers attention with
            the large, bold font and colour. This section would fill the centre
            of the screen and would be important to catch the viewers attention
            and draw them to want to explore more. The second section contains
            more information about who the website is about and a graphic image
            of them. The third section would allow them to explore more due to
            the aesthetic nature of the navigation system. The other webpages
            contained two sections. The first section allowing the viewer a
            contents list to other webpages that they may find interest in or
            provide personal information. The second section expanded on the
            topics chosen by the viewer in the first section. By using a
            contents list to help the viewer quickly locate a topic that
            interests them, allowed for the viewer not scroll through long and
            tedious webpages to find what they are looking for. This method
            provided a more efficient way of keeping the viewer engaged and not
            lose interest.
