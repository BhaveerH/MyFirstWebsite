            Metadata may sound like a modern term; however, it has been around
            for quite some time. In 1967 Stuart McIntosh and David Griffel from
            MIT were the first to use the term for computer systems. The need
            for digital “meta language” is how they described metadata. “A
            primary goal of metadata is to assist researchers in finding
            relevant information and discovering resources”. In this critical
            analysis what metadata is, why it is important and how it is used
            will be discussed and analysed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Metadata can be defined as data about content. This data refers to
            the information contained in and about the content. In simple terms
            metadata is essentially an outline of what the content is. For
            example: the author, file size and date creation of a document file
            is the type of data that metadata will collect. Metadata is data
            that is valuable to other content. On the contrary, without content
            metadata would be of little to no value. Metadata can help provide a
            simpler and more efficient way of sorting and searching for content.
            <br />
            <br />
            Metadata can be divided into three main types. These are:
            descriptive, structural, and administrative. Descriptive metadata is
            basic data about the content. For example, the author, keywords, and
            creation date. Structural metadata is data that shows how the
            content is constructed. For example, the file format and the device
            used to capture the content. Administrative metadata is data that
            shows how the content was created and how it is being maintained.
            For example, access control, specific software needed to view the
            content and intellectual property rights. From these types of
            metadata, the variation of uses and value that metadata has can be
            seen.
            <br />
            <br />
            Performing searches on the web such as a Google search also makes
            use of metadata. These web searches make use of metadata to find
            content with formats that would otherwise be difficult to find.
            These types of formats include audio, images, and videos. Metadata
            allows for a creative way of categorising digital resources which
            further allows for the more relevant web-based content. A more
            significant area is the protection of content/resources and its
            ability to be accessed in the future. Digital content needs to be
            protected from the vulnerability to be corrupted or modified. These
            no longer have to be a concern thanks to metadata.
            <br />
            <br />
            Metadata may only be data that is valuable to content, however the
            link it has between human, and machine is still important. Since
            metadata is able to describe the content, both humans and machines
            are able to gain a clear and concise understanding of it. Metadata
            can be worth investing in, especially in web design, to allow search
            engines to promote the website where applicable.
