            After being exposed to Marshal McLuhan’s, “The Medium is the
            Message”, thinking more deeply about how the medium used could
            benefit and attract viewers was important. To implement this an
            abstract background was used. The abstract background provides
            additional information that I am a person who promotes young, fresh,
            and risk-taking designs and not afraid to explore abstract ideas.
            This will communicate to the viewer that I am a web designer who
            will ensure innovation and creativity in my work.
            <br />
            Communication is a bidirectional element. Learning about how the
            communication between machine and humans exist was not something
            previously explored until now. Humans communicate to machines via
            input such as mouse and keyboard, however, for machines to
            communicate back many parameters must be implemented for this to be
            possible. The theory gained about different elements such as
            semantic markup, colour schemes, tone, metadata tagging and
            microformats were all executed into the creative and technical
            aspects. All these individual elements were used in the webpage and
            work together to help the communication between machine and human to
            exist and to grow with time.
            <br />
            Learning about internet geographies allowed for a much deeper
            thought about who around the world gets to view the content uploaded
            to the web. Not knowing if the content one uploads will actually be
            viewed by the anticipated viewer becomes a worry towards the content
            creator. Learning how content is limited and received differently in
            some countries opens the mind to the endless possibilities of
            content that we are being withheld against just because one lives in
            a minority country. Not knowing if one’s content is ‘relevant’ or
            important enough to be broadcasted throughout the world can
            discourage people to feel the need to express themselves through
            their content. However, still knowing that some content may be
            viewed and can have a positive effect on the viewers, allowing me to
            have hope and feel the need to upload more content onto the
            internet.
            <br />
            Throughout the semester it has been learnt that user experience and
            the user interface rank highly when designing a website. Consistent
            navigation and general convention make it easier and more natural
            for a viewer to interact with the site and therefore the browser.
            Subtle additions to the site to help the viewer’s experience such as
            gestures of ‘swipe’ or ‘tap’ and how just a simple mouse hover
            changes the emphasis or colour of a word, allows an animation or
            slideshow to pause or how they can select an image by just clicking
            a ‘dot’ makes the viewer to feel in control of the site and
            unknowingly be communicating with the browser.
