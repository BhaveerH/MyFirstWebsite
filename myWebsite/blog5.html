            <b>Broadband affordability </b>
            <br />
            The cost of broadband is one that would directly affect the number
            of people contributing and accessing the internet. A trend noticed
            was that the internet penetration per country was directly
            proportional to the broadband affordability. Anomalies included
            India and Sri Lanka which with growth within the last few years
            start to match the trend shown. Where the trend shows that internet
            penetration is difficult to nearly impossible to obtain with the
            broadband completely unaffordable to the local people will not
            afford them the opportunity to access and contribute to the digital
            world. “It is important to remember that there are now almost 3
            billion internet users who do have some form of access”. In the time
            that the digital world was created to give people the opportunity to
            share, contribute and access is still a great feat, however, there
            is always opportunity for this number to grow but it is
            significantly slowed by the element of cost of broadband
            affordability.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Geographies of participation</b>
            <br />
            “There appears to be large differences between access to information
            and participating in its creation and distribution”. Only content
            access seemed to be a better spread across the world compared to
            content production. Content production was more prioritized in
            certain parts of Europe and North America. It can be anticipated
            that as countries experience a more stable growth to internet
            penetration that countries will start to gain confidence in content
            creation. The countries that contributed more at this time were ones
            that would have been able to provide exposure to its people about
            how contribution is done as well as more relaxed political pressure.
            <br />
            GitHub and Wikipedia are some of the largest platforms to share
            information and content around the world. “In this specific
            instance, we were only able to use data about the English version of
            Wikipedia because the method of geolocating user profiles involved
            parsing unstructured English-language text”. This could prove to be
            an under-estimation of the countries whose first language is not
            English and an over-estimation of the English-speaking countries. As
            for GitHub commits, I believe that would fall under the education
            standards of the countries in question. The quality of education in
            certain African countries are not up to the standard of European,
            American and some Asian countries. GitHub commits rely heavily on
            users uploading code, basic education in technology can greatly
            increase the growth of participation on large digital platforms like
            these.

            <br />
            <b>Geographies of representation</b>
            <br />
            Once again it is clearly demonstrated throughout the text and
            graphical representations that South America, Middle East, and
            Africa are the places that are the poorest in terms of graphical
            representations. In terms of Geonames, some of the data can be
            considered skewed as certain places had projects funded by the
            European Union to create a geographical information infrastructure.
            This can be considered a good thing as it allows for a greater
            representation to be obtained by that country. However, as countries
            continue their steady growth the data will become less skewed and
            balanced out.
